# Dispute: 20201006 EOSIOproject telegram group governance

On October 1st 2020, `@Aneta_rocks`
[proposed](https://t.me/EOSIOproject/45303) to hand over the ownership
of https://t.me/EOSIOproject to someone else, or to delete the
group. `@cc32d9` [replied](https://t.me/EOSIOproject/45305) that he
woudldn't mind taking over the maintenance.  Aneta transferred the
ownership to `@cc32d9` later on.

Durig the following week, a lot of concerns have been raised whether
`@wilfrawilfra` and `@SirFuzzalot` are destroying and polluting the
chat with nonsense and making the community members leave.

On October 6th, `@cc32d9` proposed a resolution to the dispute, as
[follows](https://t.me/EOSIOproject/46433):


> If 20 verifiable community members sign an on-chain petition to ban
@wilfrawilfra and @SirFuzzalot , I will execute it. Otherwise, the
ownership will be transferred to @SirFuzzalot next Tuesday. If the
petition succeeds, I will start a new voting for a new community
maintainer, and the new maintainer is free to unban them if needed.

> How to vote: send a transfer of a small amount, such as 0.0001 EOS,
with the memo text that includes your Telegram handle, like this: "ban
@wilfrawilfra and @SirFuzzalot from EOSIOproject - @MYHANDLE", and send the transaction
ID to this chat and DM a copy to me.

> EOS, Telos, or WAX transactions will be fine. If you send them to "b1"
account, it will be easier to count them.
